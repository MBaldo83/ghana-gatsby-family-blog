I've been keen to try the local honey here in Ghana, and I was not disappointed!

I bought this 'pure honey' from a stall outside Shoprite on Oxford Street. My bartering game on this occasion was fairly poor, it had been a long day. The seller started at 30 Cedis and was not budging, but Â£1.50 for this tasty treat is a bargain.

This is a runny honey, it pours smoothly out of the bottle, and so far there are no crystals. The colour is dark mahogany and the strong flavour is rich but also floral.

Delicious on Porridge!

It came with some extra passengers in the bottle which are best removed before eating.
